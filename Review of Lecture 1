Review of Lecture 1: 
Insertion Sort: A sequence of numbers (a1, a2, ... , an)
A permutation reordering... (a'1, a'2, a'3, a'n) such that a'1 <= a'2 <= a'n.

The numbers we wish to sort are the keys. Conceptually, a sequence, but input comes in form of an array.

INSERTION SORT: Efficient in sorting small number of elements.
